# Akshay Trading 6 

Taking the lessons I learned from last time. At5 was a success, I got a lot better at placing trades, but then I think I scoped out too far and had trouble deciding whether to become a weather trader or a sports trader. There's a lot more volume in sports, and I thought I would be going against less informed mkt participants, but I don't think that's the case anymore.

My goal for this trading attempt is to use better messaging queues to keep the code more modular. Previously, all my messaging was through asyncio Queues, which made things very hard to debug and lengthened the feedback loop for common tasks by a lot.
